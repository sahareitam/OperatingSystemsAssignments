# Thread-Safe Structures and Simulator

## 📜 Description
This assignment explores advanced multithreading techniques and data structures:
1. **Sharable Spreadsheet**: Implements a spreadsheet that can be shared across multiple users with thread safety.
2. **Thread-Safe Binary Tree**: A binary tree that allows concurrent read/write operations.
3. **Simulator**: A simulation tool to test the functionality of the thread-safe structures.

## 🛠️ How to Run
### Sharable Spreadsheet
1. Open `SharableSpreadSheet.cs` in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the code to start using the spreadsheet.

### Thread-Safe Binary Tree
1. Open `ThreadSafeBinaryTree.cs` in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the code to test concurrent operations.

### Simulator
1. Navigate to the `Simulator` folder.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE and run it.

## 📂 Files
- `SharableSpreadSheet.cs`: Source code for the shared spreadsheet.
- `ThreadSafeBinaryTree.cs`: Source code for the thread-safe binary tree.
- `Simulator/`: Code and files for the simulator.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report explaining the structures and their usage.

## 🧪 Notes
- Ensure proper thread management when running the simulations.
- This assignment focuses on educational demonstration of thread safety in data structures.
