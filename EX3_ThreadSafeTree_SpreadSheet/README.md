# Thread-Safe Structures and Simulator

## 📜 Description
This assignment explores multithreading techniques and thread-safe data structures:
1. **Sharable Spreadsheet**: A spreadsheet that can be shared across multiple users with thread safety.
2. **Thread-Safe Binary Tree**: A binary tree that allows concurrent read/write operations.
3. **Simulator**: A tool to test the functionality of the thread-safe structures.

## 🛠️ How to Run
### Using the Simulator
1. Navigate to the `Simulator` folder.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the project to test the thread-safe structures.

## 📂 Files
- `SharableSpreadSheet.cs`: Implements the sharable spreadsheet.
- `ThreadSafeBinaryTree.cs`: Implements the thread-safe binary tree.
- `Simulator/`: Contains the simulator for testing.
- `report.pdf`: Documentation explaining the implementation and design.

## 🧪 Notes
- Ensure your IDE supports multithreading for smooth execution.
- The simulator demonstrates both the spreadsheet and binary tree functionality.
