# CPU Process and DDoS Attack

## 📜 Description
This assignment contains two parts:
1. **CPU Process Simulation**: Simulates a CPU handling multiple processes using scheduling algorithms.
2. **DDoS Attack Simulation**: A model that demonstrates how a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack operates.

## 🛠️ How to Run
### CPU Process Simulation
1. Navigate to the `CPU-Process` folder.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the main simulation file.

### DDoS Attack Simulation
1. Navigate to the `DDoSAttack` folder.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the main simulation file to observe the attack.

## 📂 Files
- `CPU-Process/`: Source code for CPU scheduling algorithms.
- `DDoSAttack/`: Source code for the DDoS attack simulation.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed explanation of the project.
- `DDoSAttack Video.mp4`: A demonstration of the DDoS attack simulation.

## 🧪 Notes
- The simulations are for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.
