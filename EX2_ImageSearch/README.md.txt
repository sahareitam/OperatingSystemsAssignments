# Image Search and Algorithms

## 📜 Description
This project consists of:
1. **Image Search**: Implements an algorithm to efficiently search for specific patterns in large image datasets.
2. **Matrix Multiplier**: Performs efficient multiplication of large matrices using multithreading.
3. **Multi-Threaded Merge Sort**: Implements a high-performance merge sort using multiple threads.

## 🛠️ How to Run
### Image Search
1. Navigate to the `ImageSearch` folder.
2. Open `ImageSearch.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

### Matrix Multiplier
1. Open `MatrixMultiplier.cs` in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the code to execute the matrix multiplication.

### Multi-Threaded Merge Sort
1. Open `MTMergeSort.cs` in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the code to sort large datasets.
